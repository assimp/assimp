Zylinder animation:

Frame 1 - 10: Zylinder knickt ein, so dass der Knick in Richtung z+ zeigt.
Frame 10 - 18: Zylinder-Spitze streckt sich in Richtung z-.
Frame 18 - 24: Zylinder-Spitze bewegt sich zu Position in Richtung x+

Remarks: The exporter failed here for some reasons... although the mesh referres to four bones, only two of them are stored in the corresponding node hierarchy. So you have a mesh with 4 bones, a hirarchy with 2 nodes and a animation that affects only those two nodes. 

There is no timing given for the animation. You have to scale the animation manually. For this file, the timing seems to be 24 ticks per second.
