# What is Tydra?

![Tydra](tydra.png)

TinyUSDZ does not support Hydra interface in pxrUSD at the moment.
We think Hydra(multi-purpose sceneDelegate/renderDelegate interface) is too much for TinyUSDZ usecases(AR, lightweight 3D viewer/runtime, DCC exchange, etc).

Instead, we'd like to propose Tydra(Tiny Hydra), something like a three-headed monster(Please imagine Gidorah: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Ghidorah), which directly converts(`publishes`) USD scene graph(Stage. Prim hierarchy) to a renderer-friendly data structure or `published` data format(imagine glTF). API design of Tydra is completely different from Hydra.

Currently Tydra is considering following three usecases in mind:

- Runtime publishment(e.g. to glTF), DCC conversion and exchange for realtime graphics(AR, VR, MR, games, etc).
- Scene conversion to GL/Vulkan renderer(e.g. WebGL rendering)
- Scene conversion to Ray tracing renderer(e.g. Vulkan/OptiX ray tracing)
  See `../../examples/sdlviewer/` for SW raytracing example.

## Status

Work in progres. API and feature is subject to change.

## RenderScene

Scene graph representation suited for OpenGL/Vulkan renderer.
