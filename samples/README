ASSIMP SAMPLES README
=====================


1. General
----------

This directory contains various samples to illustrate Assimp's
use in various real-world environments. Workspaces to build the
samples can be found in the respective directories. The VC workspaces
copy the created executables to the ./bin directory.

All GL-based samples depend on FreeGLUT, the image loading will be done 
by a header-only library. For convenience, these libraries are included
in the repository in their respective Windows/x86 prebuilt versions.
To build on linux, install freeglut using the package manager of your 
choice. For instance on Ubuntu to install freeglut you can use the following
command:

> sudo apt install freeglut

All samples will be placed at 

Win32: <assimp_repo>/<config>/bin

or Linux : <assimp_repo>/bin


2. List of samples
------------------

SimpleOpenGL

  A very simple and straightforward OpenGL sample. It loads a
  model (gets the path to it on the command line, default is dwarf.x)
  and displays the model as wireframe. Animations and materials are
  not evaluated at all. This samples uses the C interface to Assimp.
  Basic materials are displayed, but no textures.

  This sample should work virtually everywhere, provided glut
  is available.


SimpleTexturedOpenGL

  An extended OpenGL sample, featuring texturing using the DevIL 
  library. Based on SimpleOpenGL and the NeHe GL tutorial style.

  This is a Windows-only sample.
