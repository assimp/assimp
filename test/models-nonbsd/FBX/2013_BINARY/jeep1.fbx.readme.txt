Jeep designed, modelled and skinned by me, Psionic

FREE for use however you like, credits are appreciated!!!

It was modelled in Milkshape 3D and includes the MS3D files oriented for X or B3D format (BlitzBasic 3D), its 2032 polys with a 512x512 jpg texture map. There are two skin variations plus a UV template to help out if you want to create your own skin variations.

I'd love to see a few screenshots of it being used in-game so feel free to stop by my site and maybe drop by my forums and show us all what your doing with it!!!!!!!
