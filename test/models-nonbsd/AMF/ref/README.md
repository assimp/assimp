# AMF 3D model reference images

## 3_bananas.amf embedded texture
3_bananas.amf embeds a strange-looking texture, but believe when applied to the model it ends up
rendering correctly.

(Note that this is a relatively rare example of a 3D model with an "uncompressed" embedded texture,
may be useful for developers looking to test their assimp embedded texture implementations)
