READMEFIRST v1.00 last update July 20, 2008 by B. Hahne

This READMEFIRST file accompanies the cgspeed.com "BVH conversion"
release of the Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU) Graphics Lab Motion
Capture Database.  See "Where to find stuff" at the bottom of this
file for where to get the BVH conversion and/or the original CMU
dataset.

The original CMU motion capture database isn't in BVH format - it's
in ASF/AMC format.  This BVH conversion release was created by Bruce
Hahne, a hobbyist animator, in the interest of making the data more
available and easily usable by other animators.  I presently (2008)
maintain the web site www.cgspeed.com, where this BVH conversion
release will be available or linked.

The emphasis on this release is to produce BVH files that can rapidly
be used in MotionBuilder for motion retargetting.  The files are not
yet particularly Poser-friendly or DazStudio-friendly, due to
incorrect assumptions that those programs have to make about the
underlying joint rotation setup.

USAGE RIGHTS:

CMU places no restrictions on the use of the original dataset, and I
(Bruce) place no additional restrictions on the use of this particular
BVH conversion.

Here's the relevant paragraph from mocap.cs.cmu.edu:

  Use this data!  This data is free for use in research and commercial
  projects worldwide.  If you publish results obtained using this data,
  we would appreciate it if you would send the citation to your
  published paper to jkh+mocap@cs.cmu.edu, and also would add this text
  to your acknowledgments section: "The data used in this project was
  obtained from mocap.cs.cmu.edu.  The database was created with funding
  from NSF EIA-0196217."
