

Open Asset Import Library (_assimp_) - FBX Importer Branch
========

For the original README, see the [base github project this got forked from] (https://github.com/assimp/assimp).

This branch serves as my working base for my Google Summer of Code 2012 project, which is being mentored 
by Blender Foundation. The project is, in short:

 - implement assimp importing into Blender
 - implement a suitable FBX importer into assimp
 - make everything work together, i.e. give blender glorious FBX support.
 
 The full proposal / plan can be found on [BlenderWiki](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/User:Aramis_acg).
 
Future
======
This branch will be merged with assimp's trunk at the end of the summer (at least this is the plan).
