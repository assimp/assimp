This asset set is used to test the full functionality of both binary and XML Assimp scene import of the Ogre mesh and skeleton file formats and in addition the text based material parser.

* Binary mesh and skeleton files have not been modified.
* XML mesh and skeleton files were produced from the binary versions with the `OgreXMLConverter` tool.
* Material file was created by copying the relevant material parts from the sample sources. See the file for further information.
* Some textures were converted from .png to .jpg to reduce the file size.
