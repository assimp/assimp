This is the distribution of pugixml, which is a C++ XML processing library,
which consists of a DOM-like interface with rich traversal/modification
capabilities, an extremely fast XML parser which constructs the DOM tree from
an XML file/buffer, and an XPath 1.0 implementation for complex data-driven
tree queries. Full Unicode support is also available, with Unicode interface
variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings (which happen
automatically during parsing/saving).

The distribution contains the following folders:

	docs/ - documentation
		docs/samples - pugixml usage examples
		docs/quickstart.html - quick start guide
		docs/manual.html - complete manual

	scripts/ - project files for IDE/build systems

	src/ - header and source files

	readme.txt - this file.
