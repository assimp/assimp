# TinyUSDZ Python binding and prebuilt package.

TinyUSDZ provides pre-built Python binding of TinyUSDZ for Windows, Linux and macOS through PyPI.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Pip 19.3+

TinyUSDZ uses C++14, so on Linux, minimal supported `manylinux` version is `manylinux2014`.
(`manylinux2010` and `manylinux1` are not supported).

## Install

```
$ python -m pip install -U tinyusdz
```

## Build from source

`pyproject.toml` is provided, so you can build Python binding by `python-build`

```
$ python -m pip install build # if you didn't installed `build` package.
$ python -m build
```

TinyUSDZ python binding uses `scikit-build` to build Python module(and `python-build` is just involing this `scikit-build` to build a package), which provides native support of cmake.
You can alternatively build TinyUSDZ python binding by:

```
$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py bdist_wheel 
```

NOTE: you may need to delete/clean intermediate files/directories generated by `scikit-build`(e.g. `python/tinyusdz.egg-info`)
