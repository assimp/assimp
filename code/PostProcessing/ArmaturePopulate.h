/** Armature Populate: This is a post process designed
 * To save you time when importing models into your game engines
 * This was originally designed only for fbx but will work with other formats
 * it is intended to auto populate aiBone data with armature and the aiNode
 * This is very useful when dealing with skinned meshes
 * or when dealing with many different skeletons
 * It's off by default but recommend that you try it and use it
 * It should reduce down any glue code you have in your
 * importers
 * You can contact RevoluPowered <gordon@gordonite.tech>
 * For more info about this
