APIs are provided for C and C++. There are various bindings to other languages (C#, Java, Python, Delphi, D). Assimp also runs on Android and iOS.

Additionally, assimp features various __mesh post processing tools__: normals and tangent space generation, triangulation, vertex cache locality optimization, removal of degenerate primitives and duplicate vertices, sorting by primitive type, merging of redundant materials and many more.

This is the development repo containing the latest features and bugfixes. For productive use though, we recommend one of the stable releases available from [Github Assimp Releases](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/releases).

#### Repository structure ####
Open Asset Import Library is implemented in C++. The directory structure is:

	/code		Source code
	/contrib	Third-party libraries
	/doc		Documentation (doxysource and pre-compiled docs)
	/include	Public header C and C++ header files
	/scripts 	Scripts used to generate the loading code for some formats
	/port		Ports to other languages and scripts to maintain those.
	/test		Unit- and regression tests, test suite of models
	/tools		Tools (old assimp viewer, command line `assimp`)
	/samples	A small number of samples to illustrate possible
                        use cases for Assimp
	/workspaces	Build environments for vc,xcode,... (deprecated,
			CMake has superseeded all legacy build options!)


### Where to get help ###
For more information, visit [our website](http://assimp.org/). Or check out the `./doc`- folder, which contains the official documentation in HTML format.
(CHMs for Windows are included in some release packages and should be located right here in the root folder).

If the docs don't solve your problem, ask on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/assimp?sort=newest). If you think you found a bug, please open an issue on Github.

For development discussions, there is also a (very low-volume) mailing list, _assimp-discussions_
  [(subscribe here)]( https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/assimp-discussions)

Open Asset Import Library is a library to load various 3d file formats into a shared, in-memory format. It supports more than __40 file formats__ for import and a growing selection of file formats for export.
