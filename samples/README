This directory contains various samples to illustrate Assimp's
use in various real-world environments. Workspaces for all samples
are bundled in ./workspaces, makefiles can be found in the 
respective directories of the samples.

All GL-based samples depend on GLUT. For use with the VS workspaces,
it's best practice to copy glut right _here_ (./glut/) so the 
predefined build configuration will find it.

Also note that the VS workspaces links against the DLL version of the library,
thus you need to build it first (assimp-release-dll) and copy the dll to the
directory of the sample.

SimpleOpenGL

  A very simple and straightforward OpenGL sample. It loads a
  model (gets the path to it on the command line, default is dwarf.x)
  and displays the model as wireframe. Animations and materials are
  not evaluated at all. This samples uses the C interface to Assimp.
